* the text of the notification itself.

To receive notifications from e.g. 'teacherKen@gmail.com', a student:
* MUST NOT be suspended,
* AND MUST fulfill *AT LEAST ONE* of the following:
    1. is registered with â€œteacherken@gmail.com"
    2. has been @mentioned in the notification

The list of students retrieved should not contain any duplicates/repetitions.

```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hello students! @studentBetty@gmail.com @studenthon@gmail.com"
}
```
* Success response body 1:
```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentBetty@gmail.com",
      "studentAnker@gmail.com", 
      "studenthon@gmail.com"
    ]   
}
```
In the example above, studentBetty@gmail.com and studentmiche@gmail.com can receive the notification from teacherken@gmail.com, regardless whether they are registered to him, because they are @mentioned in the notification text. studenthon@gmail.com however, has to be registered to teacherKen@gmail.com.
* Request body example 2:
```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherKen@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hey everybody"
}
```
* Success response body 2:
```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studenthon@gmail.com"
    ]   
}
```
