### 4. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students who can receive a given notification.

http://localhost:3000/users/api/retrievefornotifications

* the teacher who is sending the notification, and
* the text of the notification itself.

To receive notifications from e.g. 'teacherken@gmail.com', a student:
* MUST NOT be suspended,
* AND MUST fulfill *AT LEAST ONE* of the following:
    1. is registered with â€œteacherken@gmail.com"
    2. has been @mentioned in the notification

The list of students retrieved should not contain any duplicates/repetitions.

* Endpoint: `POST /api/retrievefornotifications`
* Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
* Success response status: HTTP 200
* Request body example 1:
```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hello students! @studentagnes@gmail.com @studentmiche@gmail.com"
}
```
* Success response body 1:
```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@gmail.com",
      "studentagnes@gmail.com", 
      "studentmiche@gmail.com"
    ]   
}
```
In the example above, studentagnes@gmail.com and studentmiche@gmail.com can receive the notification from teacherken@gmail.com, regardless whether they are registered to him, because they are @mentioned in the notification text. studentbob@gmail.com however, has to be registered to teacherken@gmail.com.
* Request body example 2:
```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hey everybody"
}
```
* Success response body 2:
```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@gmail.com"
    ]   
}
```
